This interactive webpage allows users to change the background color of the page with a simple click of a button.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the page is designed with a clean and minimalistic layout. 
The color-changing functionality is powered by JavaScript,
which randomly selects a color from a predefined set of vibrant hues every time the button is clicked.

The purpose of this webpage is to demonstrate the dynamic capabilities of JavaScript in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) 
and enhancing user interaction. 
The simplicity of the design ensures that the focus remains on the core feature—changing the background color—making 
it a perfect example of how JavaScript can be used to create engaging and interactive user experiences.
